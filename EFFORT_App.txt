E.F.F.O.R.T is a program made for the tutoring center at Sheridan College.
Every month someone is responsible for creating reports for English, Math, 
Computer Science, Business Math, & Online English. They use a program that 
gathers numbers off harepoint and generates graphs and reports. These 
numbers and graphs need to be validated which can take hours to complete 
manually. This process can be tedious and can have errors as it is done manually
and can be miscounted. I have made a program that pools the numbers off of Sharepoint
and can quickly give you statistics that can be used to validate numbers and graphs. This
has made the process significantly shorter, down from a few hours to a few minutes.

This uses JavaFX for the GUI and a few plug-ins used for reading from an excel file. 

NOTE: Can only be used with .xls files.
